My idea for the mySignals website is to create a site where users can visit in order to see the best cyrptocurrency to buy at a given time. The signals that are posted will show an entry zone range of prices to buy a specific cryptocurrency, as well as 3 target prices they should sell that cryptocurrency for in order to make either a short term or long term profit. A stop loss price is also included to warn users that if the crypto drops below that price, they should sell the crypto for a small loss of profit before it dips any further. An example of a signal is the following:
